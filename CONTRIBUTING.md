## Generating Code

All code generation tasks are done in `make proto`. Make sure you have the
prerequisites installed first:

### Go

* TODO

### Java

* Download the plugin from [Maven](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.grpc%20a:protoc-gen-grpc-java)
  and save it as `./build/protoc-gen-grpc-java`.
